Run-through of most recent ProDelphinus data (Aug 2016-Feb 2018)

```{r}
skim (sets_18)
```
Lots of missing dates shown (1/3), but I think this is a m/d/y d/m/y issue. Looks in the dataset that there are really only two missing dates. 

## Map points
```{r map}
sz.juv.map <- get_map (location = c (min (juv.sz.PA$Lon, na.rm = TRUE), min (juv.sz.PA$Lat, na.rm = TRUE), max (juv.sz.PA$Lon, na.rm = TRUE), max (juv.sz.PA$Lat, na.rm = TRUE)), maptype = "terrain", zoom = 6)
```
